AWS :

globle --> region --> multiple zones

Globle Services : 
  - IAM
  - Route 53 (DNS)
  - CloudFrount (Content deivery Network)
  - WAF (Web application firewall)
  
IAM : 
	- user
	- Group
	- roles
  - IAM security Tools : 
	- IAM cred report : report of all Account user and status of their various cred
	- IAM ACcess ADvisor : show geanted user Permissions and lass access status
	
EC2 : IaaS ,Elastic compute cloud
 - can run : 
	- EC2
	- EBS
	- ELB 
	- ASG auto scaling group
 - things needed in EC2 creations : 
	- OS 
	- CPU
	- RAM
	- storage : 
		- EBS :  it persist data after instance termination
		- EC2 instance store (hardware) 
	- network card L VPC
	- Firewall- security group
		- can allow only , inbound and outbound rules 
		- can be attached with other security groups . to alloy traffic between other instances 
	  - ports: 
		- 22 : ssh secure shell
		- 21 = FTP file transfer protocol
		- 22 = SMTP secure file transfer protocol
		- 80 = hhtp
		- 443 = https
		- 3389 = RDB for wondows
	- bootstarp script if needed
	
- elastic IP : is a fixed IP address we can get . with one account we can have 5 IP max 
	
- placement group and strategies: 
	 - cluster : low latency group ---- single AZ
	 - spreed : spreads instance across underlying hardware (max 7 ins per group per AZ)
	 - partition : 
	
- electic network interfaces (ENI) : 
	- Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.
	- We can attach multiple EN to instance .
- EC2 hibernation state : where system RAM stat will be store in EBS. and when u start the system . system will start quickly 
- EBS : will be created seperatly , it is AZ specific . means you can not attach AZ1 EBS to AZ2 instance. this can be mask as persist if system terminate , Then EBS will be availave to use in Volume section , single instance can attach to multiple EBS but multiple instance can not connect to single EBS 
	- We can take snapshot of EBS and migrate them into other AZ
	- EBS snapshot can be move to EBS archive for cheaper storage 
	- EBS snapshot after deletion will be put under recycle bin with retention time of 1 day to 1 year 
	- EBS multi attach for io1 and io2 family , in io2 we can enable multi attach policy to EBS so it can be attached to upto 16 instance in same AZ
	- EBS encryption : 
- AMI : Amazon machine image : customize Images and put that on amazon market place
	- To build image we can create image from running instance
	- AMI images are regio specific
	
- EC2 instance store : is high performance hardware disk / this are ephemeral storage : If hardware fail this fail.

- Amazon EFS : Elastic File System : 
	- EFS is managed NFS that can be mounted on many EC2 in diffrent AZ or multi AZ 
	- use case : content managment , web serving ,data sharing
	- protocol NFSv4.1
	- use SG to control access
	- campatible with only linux based AMI
	- Pay per use .no capacity planing 
	
- Scalability and high availability :
	- scalability type : 
		- horizontal scaling : instance 
		- Vertical Scaling : database
	- availability : 
		- scaling group in multi AZ : 
			- multi AZ load balancer 
			- multi AZ instance group / EC2 auto scaling gorups / AWS ECS
- Elastic Load balancer is managed aws service :  
		- spread load Accross downsteam instance
		- Expose single point of access(DNS) to your application
		- handle failures od downsteam instance by using instance health checks
		- provide SSL termination(https) for application
		- Enforce stickiness with cookiues
		- High availability across Zones
		- Separate public trafic for private trafic
		
	- 4 type Of ELB: 
		- classic load balancer (old gen) // depricated and removed 
		 - http,https,tcp,ssl,TLS
		- Application load balancer (layer 7 LB)
		 -  http,https, WebSocket
		 - has to create target groups to send request to
		 - has to create Rules to forword request to corrent instance
		- Network load balancer : 
		 - tcp,TLS, UDP
		 - has one static IP per AZ and support assinging Elastic IP
		 - handle millions of request 
		 - ultra low latency
		 - has to create target groups to send request to (EC2, private IP address of on prem system or EC2, can put NLB in front of ALB)
		 - 
		- Gateway load balancer :
		 -  Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) - ip protocol
		 - deploy scale and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in aws
		 - can sun firewalls, intrusion detection and precention systems , deep packet inspection system, payload manupulation etc..
		 
	- user call http/https ----> load balancer (security groupp will allow access to HTTP/https) ---------> EC2 (security group allow access to ELB security group)
	
	- stickiness session : can enable cookie at client side and can stick client to a static instance or a non repetive instance. can in tach user seesion as cookies says

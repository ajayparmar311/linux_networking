#### process management #####################

to run process in backgroud: 

--- first run the commandn like : sleep 100
--- then press control-z : that will stop the running process 
--- you can check stopped process by ===   jobs ===== command 
--- then you can put the process in backgroud by === bg === command
--- if you want to bring back the same command in forground then type === fg ===

To run a process in backgroud and also after closing the ternminal 
--- we use === nohup ===  command 
--- Example :  nohup sleep 100 > /dev/null 2>&1 &

To run any process on priority
--- we use === nice === command
--- nice scale goes to -20 to 19  the lower number gets more priority 
--- example : nice -n 5 process (nice -5 sleep 100)

-- interface detection
-- Assigning an IP address
-- interface configuration files
	- /etc/nsswitch.conf     ==> where it should resolve its host addr to ip address
	- /etc/host
	- /etc/sysconfig/network ==> in RHEL to set static ip
	- /etc/netplan/01-network-manager-all.yaml==> in ubuntu to change staticip
